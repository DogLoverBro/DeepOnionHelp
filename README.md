## Description

DeepOnion is an anonymous cryptocurrency that integrates Tor natively. We increase the level of privacy for our crypto users to reduce the likelihood of being hacked or attacked by other legal & illegal entities. Our highest priority is the privacy of our users. You can now quickly send and accept private transactions using our secure digital wallet. Unlike other anonymous cryptocurrencies, DeepOnion is not just a privacy coin. We also developed [DeepVault](https://deeponion.org/#deepvault). DeepVault is a blockchain notary that protects your work against theft, counterfeiting, and corporate espionage.
