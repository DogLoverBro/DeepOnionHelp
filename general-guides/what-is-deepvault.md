# What is DeepVault?

DeepVault is a feature that allows users to add a cryptographic hash to a document, image or any file and record it in the DeepOnion blockchain. As long as the document hash remains the same, then a user can be confident that the document has not been altered. Think of it as a way to ensure that a document remains unchanged and legitimate. 

Any other person can check the document hash and confirm that the document or file is unaltered. It's basically a way to confirm the authenticity of a file. If the hash has changed, then a person can tell that the file has been altered.
