# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do you premine, Instead of ICO?

We want our project to be a huge success. Our success is tightly linked to the commitment of our knowledgeable development team and our large community. Instead of taking an ICO where the Dev team would primarily be risk-free and disconnected from their members, we want to be different, and our community is of high importance to us. Anyone who holds the coin and develops it is together part of one beautiful community.   
  
Our goal is to provide many real-world uses for our cryptocurrency. We have e-commerce [payment plugins](https://deeponion.org/accept-deeponion.html), and it is easy to start accepting DeepOnion as a payment method. We also have DeepVault to verify file integrity and many upcoming developments. We want DeepOnion to be an essential part of many people and businesses worldwide.

25 million or 25,000,000 ONION in about ten years.

## **Is DeepOnion vulnerable to 51 percent attacks?**

No. DeepOnion has the majority of the coins in PoS thus making it more resistant. Mining centralization will be less appealing as a 51 percent attack will be extremely difficult.

## **What is Tor®?**

Tor® stands for The Onion Router. It is a non-centralized open source network that allows people all over the world to make use of the internet as an unknown user. It achieved this by directing IP address information to different nodes on the network. It helps users guard against traffic analysis, a kind of network monitor that does not give room for user privacy, regarding business activities, national security, relationships, etc.  
  
Please visit the official Tor® website at [https://www.torproject.org](https://www.torproject.org).

## **Are you affiliated with the Tor® project?**

## **How can I use the name Tor®?**

The Tor Project encourages developers to use the name Tor in ways that do not confuse the public about the source of anonymity software and services. If you are building open-source non-commercial software or services that incorporate or work with The Tor Project's code, you may use the name “Tor” in an accurate description of your work. We ask you to include a link to the official Tor website https://www.torproject.org/ so users can verify the original source of Tor for themselves, and a note indicating that the Tor project does not sponsor your project.
