# Wallet Closes Automatically

You need to add the rpcuser and rpcpassword lines to the top of your DeepOnion.conf file. That is why it closes shortly after starting up.

Add these two links to your .conf file.

```text
rpcuser=DeepOnionrpc
rpcpassword=EnterPassword
```

Please change the password shown above in the rpcpassword line.
