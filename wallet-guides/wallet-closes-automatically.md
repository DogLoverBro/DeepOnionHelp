# Wallet Closes Automatically

You need to add the rpcuser and rpcpassword lines to the top of your DeepOnion.conf file.

Add these two lines to your .conf file.

```text
rpcuser=DeepOnionrpc
rpcpassword=EnterPassword
```

Please change the password shown above in the rpcpassword line.

Attention: This rpcpassword alert is normally only the case for Mac OS wallets.
