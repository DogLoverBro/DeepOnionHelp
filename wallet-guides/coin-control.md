# Coin Control

1. Go to Settings, options, display and mark the checkbox "Display Coin Control Features". Click Ok.
2. Go to Send Coins and Inputs.
3. You will see a list \(Tree mode\) with different blocks of coins.
4. There, you can select from which block of coins you want to make your transaction. I recommend that you select small blocks until you get the amount that you need.
5. Click Ok.
6. Mark checkbox "custom change address" and introduce where you want to send your change. For example, if you select a block 135 ONION in the last step and you need to send 100, 35 \(change\) ONION will be sent to the specified address.
7. Make your payment, and that's it.
