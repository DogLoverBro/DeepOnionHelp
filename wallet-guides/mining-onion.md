# Mining ONION

**First Step**  
  
Create an account on [NiceHash](https://new.nicehash.com/).   
  
If you like, you can learn more about Nicehash [here](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/pools/nicehash/).

**Second Step**  
  
Fund your account with some BTC. A little goes a long way -- 0.01 is required.

**Third Step**  
  
Once your BTC have become available within your Nicehash wallet \(2 confirms\), go to to **For buyers** -&gt; **My pools** and enter the pool data. In our case, kawaiipool.party! Stratum raw options supplied by the pool: -o stratum+tcp://kawaiipool.party:3633 -u &lt;WALLET\_ADDRESS&gt; \[-p &lt;OPTIONS&gt;\]. Confirm that you set your wallet address correctly. The pool will pay out directly to the address you define. Use kawaiipool.party, port 3633. Username is your wallet address. Set any password you want. Make sure that you choose the X13 algorithm. See picture:

Now go to **For buyers** -&gt; **Marketplace**  
  
Select **X13**. This is DeepOnion's mining algorithm. Here you can see who bids what price for how much hashing power. People buy and sell hashing power. You can outbid the highest order in either, or both, the European or US zone. Set your maximum bid and a hash limit according to your desires. Nicehash is very convenient, you can cancel your bid at any time and set a new one \(minimum bid 0.01\). Here's an example:

Lastly, create your order.

Are you mining correctly? Check the stats for your address here. You can also see how much GH/s or MH/s you are generating. Change the link's YourAddress with your address: [http://kawaiipool.party/?address=YourAddress](http://kawaiipool.party/?address=YourAddress)  
  
Congratulations! You are now mining ONION. Collect as many as you like and can! ![:\)](https://deeponion.org/community/styles/default/xenforo/clear.png)  
  
The pool we use in this guide, kawaiipool.party, pays out hourly. Have fun, and good luck.
